The main properties of the AlertDialog widget are:
* Title: This property gives the title to an AlertDialog box that occupies at the top of the
AlertDialog. It is always good to keep the title as short as possible so that the user knows
about its use very easily. We can write the title in AlertDialog as below:
* Action: It displays below the content. For example, if there is a need to create a button to
choose yes or no, then it is defined in the action property only. We can write an action
attribute in AlertDialog as below:
* Content: This property defines the body of the AlertDialog widget. It is a type of text,
but it can also hold any kind of layout widgets
